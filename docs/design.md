# Lab 4 Design Document

## Design Decisions
### Lab 4 Redesign

- Changed colour slightly to make sure contrast was high enough
- Added aria labels to all buttons
- Add "Sort by" text in front of the sorting options to contextualize the dropdown
- For bigger screens, no need to change the design. For smaller screens, shift the UI components to be organized by columns instead of rows

### Alternate Designs


## User Testing


### User testing 1

As we can see from the texts above, the changes were well recieved. Having them test together and interact with each other also highlighted parts of the app that really stood out.

## Final Design
Note: previous functionality such as editing, deleting, adding todos are in `design-lab2.md` and is excluded from here to avoid repetition.

1. Landing page (with tasks)
